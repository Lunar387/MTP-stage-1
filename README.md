# Thermal Pure Quantum states approach to spin systems
- These are the codes for obtaining the plots in my master's thesis - stages 1 and 2

- I have generated Microcanonical Thermal Pure Quantum states.
- Then I have found out the magnetization, correlation function and Temperature using these pure states
- The first stage correspnds to studies on an isolated system
- The second stage corresponds to studies on a system attached to a thermal bath

- System used is an XXZ Heisenberg chain (verification purposes).
- Further application to embedded spin systems
