# MTP-stage-1
- These are the codes for obtaining the plots in my master's thesis - stage 1

- I have generated Microcanonical Thermal Pure Quantum states, as prescribed by Sugiura and Shimizu.
- Then I have found out the magnetization, correlation function and Temperature using these pure states

- System used is an XXZ Heisenberg chain.
- My thesis is not online, will link to it when it is done.
