# MTP-stage-1
- These are the codes for obtaining the plots in my master's thesis - stages 1 and 2

- I have generated Microcanonical Thermal Pure Quantum states, as prescribed by Sugiura and Shimizu [PRL 108, 240401 (2012) and PRL 111, 010401 (2013)].
- Then I have found out the magnetization, correlation function and Temperature using these pure states
- The first stage correspnds to studies on an isolated system
- The second stage corresponds to studies on a system attached to a thermal bath

- System used is an XXZ Heisenberg chain.
- My thesis is not online, will link to it when it is done.
